## 📌 Project Description

This project allows users to interact with **SQL databases using natural language**. Built using:

- 🛠️ **LangChain SQL Toolkit** for query generation
- 🎨 **Streamlit** for interactive UI
- 🤖 **OpenRouter-hosted LLMs** (e.g., `mistralai/codestral-2508`)

It supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, and is designed to help users ask complex questions without knowing SQL.
